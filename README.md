# Data Analysis COVID-19 South Korea
Optional Assignment in the Course "Data Analysis and Visualisation in R" using the Kaggle dataset [Data Science for COVID-19 (DS4C)](https://www.kaggle.com/kimjihoo/coronavirusdataset). This course was selected as part of my curriculum in my student exchange in the Technical University of Munich.

Group project with [@ertugela](https://github.com/ertugela)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Open Git Bash and clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/EfthymiaKostaki/DataAnalysisCOVIDSouthKorea.git
```

Change to the main repository by running

```
cd DataAnalysisCOVIDSouthKorea
```

Then, download first the [Kaggle dataset linked](https://www.kaggle.com/kimjihoo/coronavirusdataset) and add it to the project folder.

You can run the .Rmd directly via terminal if R is present in your computer or if you have RStudio the file .Rmd can be imported there.
